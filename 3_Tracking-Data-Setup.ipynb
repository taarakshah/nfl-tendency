    "# NFL Data Tracking Analysis / Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go over an outline of how to utilize NFL tracking data to classify coverages and WR routes. I am using the framework outlined by this paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dutta et al, 2019, \"Unsupervised Methods for Identifying Pass Coverage Among Defensive Backs with NFL Player Tracking Data\" https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.11373\n",
    "\n",
    "The animations and plots of tracking data are from the following Kaggle notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/nfl-big-data-bowl-plotting-player-position\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/ar2017/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021-animating-players-movement\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate objective is first to follow the methodology of the paper to classify man vs zone in coverage, then adapt what was done to see if I can build an supervised classification model to identify routes run by the receiver if they were targeted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods of the Paper\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they define a set of features from the tracking data that distinguish between \"man\" and \"zone\" coverage. They use mixture models to create clusters corresponding to each group, allowing them to provide probabilistic assignments to each coverage type (or cluster). Additionally, they quantify each feature’s influence in distinguishing defensive pass coverage types. First, I will attempt to replicate the features they built, only on week 1 of the tracking data just to test it out."

    "Something to focus on is on player routes and quantifying their effectiveness against man vs zone coverages. Using the framework from above, I have a method to determine whether the corner closest to a receiver is playing in man vs zone (i.e. it doesn't generalize for the entire defense, since there are some hybrid defenses and whatnot).\n",

    "What we need to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify whether a route runner is lined up against a defender with a classification for man vs zone\n",
    "- If they are, then find their outcome for the play\n",
    "     - If they were targeted, if caught, and if caught then how many yards?\n",
    "- Also identify players who maximize yards against man, players who maximize yards against zone\n",
    "    - A step further: which routes maximize yardage vs coverages? How to adjust for potential outliers / \"explosive plays\"?\n",
    "    - One option is to consider yard line of receiver where the ball is caught, and consider that the metric to use"
