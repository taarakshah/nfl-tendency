    "# Useful Features Present in Both Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Before cleaning the data, from a cursory examination of our data, the main features I think will be useful in this analysis are the following. We can only use pre-snap features in this analysis, or else it defeats the purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type of play (run/pass): TARGET (need to create)\n",
    "- Drive number (need to create / merge with pbp)\n",
    "- Offensive / defensive team (`HomeTeamAbbr`, `VisitorTeamAbbr`, `PossessionTeam`, need to create `DefTeam`)\n",
    "- Quarter of the game (`Quarter`)\n",
    "- Down number (`Down`)\n",
    "- Time left in a quarter (`GameClock`, need to format this)\n",
    "- Yards to gain for a first down (`Distance`)\n",
    "- Yards to gain for a touchdown (100 minus current yardline position, `YardLine`)\n",
    "- Current score in the game (model as difference, `HomeScoreBeforePlay - VisitorScoreBeforePlay`)\n",
    "- Offensive formation (`OffenseFormation`)\n",
    "- Offensive personnel (`OffensePersonnel`)\n",
    "- Defenders in the box (`DefendersInTheBox`)\n",
    "- Defensive personnel (`DefensePersonnel`)\n",
    "- Week of season (`Week`)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Useful Features Present Only in Rushing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Some features are only included in the rushing play data. However, for 2018 alone, we could match up the games and include further information in the analysis for pass plays as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stadium type (`StadiumType`)\n",
    "- Turf or grass (`Turf`)\n",
    "- Weather in game (`GameWeather`)\n",
    "- Temperature on game day (`Temperature`)\n",
    "- Humidity on game day (`Humidity`)\n",

    "- Wind direction (`WindDirection`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps / Preparing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it more useful to do an analysis on an imbalanced dataset with rushing 2017-2019 and passing 2018, with only the first subset of features?\n",
    "- Or would I rather narrow down the rushing plays to only 2018, and use all features (can match up `GameID` and thus find the weather/stadium data by game for the passing plays as well)\n",
    "- Aside from that, still need to complete the following data cleaning steps regardless of which direction I choose:\n",
    "    - Merge both datasets into same format\n",
    "    - Ignore post-snap outcomes (i.e. yardage gained, direction of the run, play results, type of pass dropback)\n",
    "    - Ignore tracking data (for now) since all of it is post-snap movements\n",
    "        - Look into if I can see whether a play is in \"motion\" i.e. the WR shifting from the X spot to the slot\n",
    "        - I have the \"time of snap\" data, so there may be some potential?\n",
    "    - Change the offensive formation to one-hot encoded columns\n",
    "    - Change the personnel for offense and defense to one-hot encoded columns\n",
    "        - Or find a unique way to deal with this since there are many combinations, some with few observations\n",
    "    - Narrow down each play to a single row\n",
    "    - More TBD.."

    "# Merging 2018 run/pass\n",
    "\n",
    "First I will try the simpler case, where we have more features but must narrow our scope to only 2018 plays. We can match these games on `GameID` which will remove run plays in 2017 and 2019. The key issue is that the run data contains many rows for the same play, since the tracking data is baked in. The solution is to remove the tracking data for the rush dataset, effectively leaving one row per play, then merging the two datasets on their `GameID`. I will do this below by grouping on `PlayID` and only retaining information on the play as a whole. Maybe I'll go back to individual players and see if there's an avenue to work with tracking data / pre-snap motion later and add it in as my own feature...we'll see."
