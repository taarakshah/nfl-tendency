# nfl-tendency
Tendency analysis framework for NFL play-by-play data. This project will serve as my thesis for MS Statistics. Currently a work in progress.

Goal is to predict run/pass for NFL Data Bowl data from 2020 and 2021. I want to see how offensive and defensive formations and personnel will impact the probability that the offense will call a run or pass play.
